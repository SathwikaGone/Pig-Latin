Mobile Computing Android
Assignment #1
Points: 65
Goal: Build a simple app with an image, editable text, text view, and a button.
Requirements:
1) The image should be one that includes you. The image should cover the top
1/2 of the screen.
2) Just below the image will be the text view component. It will span the screen
and should start with "Pig Latin:".
3) There should be an editable plain text in the screen below the text view all
the way to the right..
4) The button should be just below the editable text component and have the
title "Convert to Pig Latin"
5) The button will have an onClick action that take the string from the editable
text component and get the first word from the input. It will take the word
and find the pig latin equivalent and append the result to the text view. (Add
a space so that the words don't run together.
Pig Latin rules: (Examples are given in the table.)
1) If a word starts with vowel ( a, e, i, o, or u) , add "way" to the end of the
word.
2) If the word starts with a consonant, take all the consonants up to but not
including the first vowel and put them at the end of the word followed by
"ay".
and - andway
out - outway
hello - ellohay
thing - ingthay
christmass - istmasschray
Bonus:
• Change the properties (Size, Color, Font) of the text.
• Change the app name.
• Modify the pig latin generator to apply correctly to hyphenated words. (do
each part seperatly.) E.g. "happy-lucky" will translate to "appyhay-uckylay".
• Add in a button that will take a word in pig latin and convert it back.
• Make the pig latin translator correctly handle capitalized words. E.g., ,
"Hello" will translate to "Ellohay".
• Add in a clear button for the text view that takes it back to "Pig Latin:"
• Modify the onClick action so that it takes each word in the input and
translates it to pig latin and adds the result to the text view.
• Add in another editable plain text and change the text in a different way.
Note: There is lot of scope for improvement in the application. So use your
creativity and beautify the application.
